Screen printing is more than just a production method - it's an art form that brings our folk-inspired designs to life. At Folk Fusion, we take pride in our traditional screen printing process that combines time-honored techniques with modern precision.

## The Screen Printing Journey

Every Folk Fusion t-shirt begins its journey as an artist's sketch before transforming through these essential steps:

1. Design Digitization
2. Screen Preparation
3. Color Separation
4. Test Prints
5. Production Run
